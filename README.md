# Program Exit Assessment

Viacheslav Knyazev

## Colours

The colour palette was based on Heritage's own colour selection. The idea is to present the Program Exit Assessment as a work derived from the teachings of the program.

## Design of the Banner

The banner prominently features the purpose of the site and the context for it, followed by the navigation menu. The menu has large clickable areas which are comfortable to click and tap to either open or expand. The logo is used a decor without distracting from the content.

## CSS3 Features

 - `border-radius`: Rounded corners for the menu items
 - `display: flex`: Facilitated alignment of menu items and splits the table of contents away from the first paragraph.
 - Tools used:

    - [CEGEP Heritage Website](https://cegep-heritage.qc.ca) used as the primary source of colours
