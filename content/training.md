The linear nature of the business flows within our system allows training to be very light. A video demonstrating each flow would suffice. The flows for teachers are queue management, schedule management and reporting. For students, the system provides detailed guidance throughout their flow. 


Additionally, the application features guidance throughout the system with tooltips, text fragments and a complete FAQ for use-case walkthroughs and answers to possible concerns.
