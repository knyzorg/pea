# Types of Maintenance Projects

The maintenance course covered the different types of maintenance (Corrective, Adaptive, Perfective, Preventitive) and their respective purposes. 

## Corrective Maintenance

Corrective maintenance is for fixing issues which were not addressed during the development phase of the project such as bugs.

## Adaptive Maintenance

Adaptive maintenance is for adapting the system's internals in order to allow to it to run in a different environment such as a different OS or different database.

## Perfective Maintennace

Perfective maintenance is when the system is iterated upon with new requirements or features.

## Preventative Maintenance

Preventative maintenance is when the system is worked on in order to support the system's long-term viability by fixing issues which could lead to degradation of quality.

The types of maintenance we applied in this course were perfective and corrective. Our perfective work was focused on improved user experience surrounding reporting, while corrective work was performed with the goal of fixing existing bugs.

# System Introduction

The purpose of the Maintenance Project course is to peform maintenance on real systems used by the college. This allows students to experience the real-world reality of maintaining other people's code. The project we worked on was the Application Management System (AMS). AMS is used to map roles onto Active Directory members in order to provide a centralized end-point for authentication and authorization for other systems.

# Modifications Summary

Refactoring is the process of modifying code in order to improve it while retaining equivalent functionality. It often improves code quality, readability and performance. The searching for users functionality in AMS was refactored for improved performance.

Additionally, the system has been modified in other ways. Firstly, AMS's architecture has been modified to transition away from using stored procedures for business logic and towards the business logic layer. Secondly, there were multiple improvements surrounding AMS's reporting features to include more details on the New Semester functionality.

# Methodology Overview

The Agile methodology has been applied throughout the Maintance course. All work was tasked out into user stories and assigned to team members. In an effort to save time, we opted for a single 2-week sprint with daily scrums which we used to make sure we were aware of any blockers.

# Team Environment

## Team Members

Our team was composed of 5 people, including an Assistant Project Manager (APM). Work was allocated on the basis of priority, in order to make sure the most important tasks were completed, even if it meant that not everything would be.
