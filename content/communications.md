# Research Project

The systems class featured a research portion where we were to present new subjects which could be incorporated into the Heritage program. I presented the Rust programming language and have found that it would be beneficial to include it in the curiculuum as it a powerful tool for teaching memory constructs. The project featured a [report](/files/Rust.docx) and a [presentation](/files/Rust.pptx)
