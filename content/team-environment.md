During the course of Development Project I and II, the teams for each project were staffed according to complexity with team sizes ranging from 4 to 6 people. My team was composed of four members: Cody Douris-Peeke, Patrick Mirowski, Thomas Palaisy and myself. We worked efficiently in a conflict-free manner while trying to be as helpful as possible to one another. Each of us naturally drifted into a preferred aspect of the project, and always knew what needed to be done, coordinated by our assisant project manager (APM).

# Experience

Personally, I enjoyed working with my team as they consistently demonstrated either competence in an area or were willing to put in the work necessary to understand it. This made it so I could reliably delegate work items, knowing that they would be completed properly. 

# Highlights

Team members were always happy to volunteer whatever knowledge they had, wrote code in a consistent style and implemented features with predictable logic, making it very easier to jump into. However, our team struggled with setting priorities, often under-estimated the necessary effort for features, and worked in a different stack than other teams thereby limiting the usefulness of other teamsâ€™ work.
